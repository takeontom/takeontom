              In addition to making dozens of other successful websites, I've
              advised major charities and trade groups on digital
              strategy, appeared on BBC radio a few times, rebranded a PLC,
              content audited an exemplar GDS service, been a #[em fearsome]
              cake judge at baking competitions and was a semi-pro gamer...
              unfortunately, before that sort of thing was cool.
